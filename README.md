# Data Cleaning Pipeline

## Overview
This project processes and cleans data extracted from `.bag` files (commonly used in ROS - Robot Operating System). The goal is to convert raw sensor or simulation data into a usable, well-structured format through a multi-step cleaning pipeline.

---

## Input Format
- **`.bag` file**  
  Raw data file typically generated by a ROS system.

---

## Processing Flow (Exact Order)

1. **`Bag_to_csv.py`**  
   Converts the `.bag` file into a `.csv` file containing all message data.

2. **`CSV_column_clean.py`**  
   Cleans and standardizes CSV columns, removing unnecessary fields.

3. **`space_cleaner.py`**  
   Removes extra spaces from the CSV content.

4. **`csv_to_text.py`**  
   Converts the cleaned CSV into a plain text `.txt` file.

5. **`space_cleaner.py`** (run again)  
   Re-cleans the converted text file for any residual spacing issues.

6. **`delete_unwanted_text.py`**  
   Removes unwanted strings, special characters, or clutter from the text.

7. **`text_editor.py`**  
   Applies custom formatting and edits to the text content.

8. **`test2.py`**  
   formats the text file to into a proper csv file with time, id, x, and y position.

9. **`random_cleaner.py`**  
   Cleans up unexpected anomalies or irregular formatting left behind.

10. **`del_columns.py`**  
    Removes specific data columns unecessary from the text or structured dataset.

11. **`time_editor.py`**  
    Edits or aligns time-related fields for consistency and readability.

12. **`grouping.py`**  
    Groups data entries logically (e.g., by event, time, or category) for final use.

## Output
- A cleaned and structured `.csv` file ready for:
  - Data analysis
  - Visualization
  - Machine learning pipelines

---

## Future Improvements
- Automate the full pipeline using a wrapper script.
- Add logging and error handling to improve robustness.
- Add unit tests to verify outputs after key steps.

---

##  Notes
- Ensure required Python packages (e.g., `pandas`, `rosbag`, etc.) are installed.
- Scripts can be reused or modified for other `.bag` file workflows.
